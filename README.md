# Planning-Poker

The planningDeck shall have 3 steps:
“Count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the
number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two,
excepting that thou then proceed to three.” Holy Grail: The Screenplay, page 76.

1. Select phase: You can select any card. When you select one, you will move on to the
Waiting phase.

2. Waiting phase: Only show the chosen card with its backside up (awaiting others to
choose a card using some similar app or actual cards). An simple interaction shall get
you to Reveal phase.

3. Reveal phase: The card that you chose in step one is revealed. Another interaction will
then get you to Select phase again.
